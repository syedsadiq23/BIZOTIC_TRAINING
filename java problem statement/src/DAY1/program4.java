// was already dark. He told her to see the trees while returning back and said that the first tree 
// with two digits number will help her find the way and the way to go back to her home is the 
// sum of digits of the tree and that numbered way will lead her to the tree next to the wardrobe 
// where she can find the others. Lucy was already confused, so pls help her in finding the route 
// to her home.... Input Format: Input consists of an integer corresponding to the 2-digit number.
